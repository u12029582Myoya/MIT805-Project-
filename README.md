MIT805 Project S2
The full dataset consists of two Comma-separated values (csv) files of data collected on customer activity from a large multi category online store during the month of October and November 2019. The online store is a website hosted in a country in the Middle East. Each row in the file represents an event such as a user viewing an item (‘view’), a user adding an item to cart (‘cart’), a user removing an item from cart (‘remove_from_cart’), and a user purchasing an item (‘purchase’). All events are related to products and users. Each event can be described as a many-to-many relation between products and users. Each event was recorded the moment it happened to the second. In total, the number of entries of the entire dataset is 109,950,743 events.
The size of each file is as follows:
•	“2019-Oct.csv”: 5.67 GB
•	“2019-Nov.csv”: 9.01 GB
The data is structured, therefore little-to-no standardisation will be required. Section 2.2 outlines the data properties. The full dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store 

Insights drawn from data:
Based on the insights derived, the following strategies could be considered to increase purchases within the site:
1.	Develop a niche brand where the website focuses on only selling electronics and appliances, that way all resources can be concentrated on the product categories that bring in the highest percentage of purchases
2.	Employ aggressive advertising between the 1st of the month to the 15th of the month given that the highest number of purchases occur during this time. 
In future, investigation can be carried out to determine the frequent users and the highest spenders on the site and thus develop a strategy of targeted marketing to these groups of customers.
